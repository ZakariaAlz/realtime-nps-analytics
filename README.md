# realtime-nps-analytics
Hey there! 👋 This was my very first data engineering project, built with my good friend Aymen Benniou—who we lost last year. Prayers for him. 🙏  We set up Kafka to stream customer feedback, used Flink to crunch the numbers, and made a simple dashboard so you can see your NPS live.  Give it a spin and let me know what you think! 😊
