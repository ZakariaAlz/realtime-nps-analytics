# Real-Time NPS Analysis Solution üöÄ

Dive into the heart of customer satisfaction with our Real-Time Net Promoter Score (NPS) Analysis Solution. Developed at Telecom Djezzy, this project brings the cutting edge of Data/Event Stream Processing to your fingertips, enabling actionable insights from customer feedback, instantly.

## üìñ Overview

Leveraging Apache Kafka for seamless event streaming, Apache Flink for meticulous data processing, and container technologies like Docker or Podman for effortless deployment, our solution calculates NPS in real-time and visualizes this data through an intuitive dashboard. This enables immediate actions to enhance customer satisfaction.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Embark on your journey to real-time analytics by setting up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Docker/Podman:** Follow the official guides to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) on your system.
- **Java:** Ensure you have Java installed for backend development. [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Maven:** Needed for building and managing the project. [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Recommended IDE for an enhanced development experience. [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone this repository**

git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/yourrepositoryname.git
cd yourrepositoryname

2. **Install Python dependencies** 

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Launch Docker Containers** 

Ensure Docker Desktop/ Podman is running and execute:

docker-compose up -d  # For Docker users
# or
podman-compose up -d  # For Podman users


This starts Kafka, Flink, Prometheus, Grafana, and AKHQ, etc.. 

4. **Generate Data**

Kickstart the data generation:

python data-gen.py

## üìä Visualizing the Data

- Prometheus Monitoring:

Access Prometheus at http://localhost:9090 to monitor your Kafka and Flink metrics.

- Grafana Dashboards:

Visit http://localhost:3000 to explore the real-time analytics dashboards. Default login is admin/admin; it's recommended to change these credentials.

- AKHQ Interface:

Explore your Kafka clusters by navigating to http://localhost:8080. AKHQ provides a user-friendly GUI for your Kafka environment, allowing you to monitor topics, view data, and manage your setup efficiently.

## üåê Real-Time Dashboard
The heart of our solution is the real-time dashboard powered by Grafana, providing a live view of NPS scores and customer feedback trends. This dashboard is designed for immediate insight into customer satisfaction levels, enabling quick decision-making and proactive measures to improve service quality.

To access and customize the dashboard:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Log in with the default or your customized credentials.
Explore the pre-configured NPS analytics panels or create your own for tailored insights.

Here's an overview of our Dashboard in Grafana :
